# AirCanvas Project using Computer Vision

This repository contains the code and resources for the AirCanvas project, which utilizes computer vision techniques to create a virtual canvas that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures.

## Project Overview

The AirCanvas project leverages computer vision and machine learning to detect hand gestures and translate them into drawing commands on a virtual canvas. The primary technologies used in this project include OpenCV for computer vision tasks and various machine learning models for hand gesture recognition.

## Features

- **Hand Detection and Tracking:** Uses computer vision techniques to detect and track hand movements in real-time.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognizes specific hand gestures to control drawing actions such as selecting colors and clearing the canvas.
- **Drawing on Virtual Canvas:** Allows users to draw on a virtual canvas by moving their hand in the air.
- **Color Selection:** Users can change the drawing color using predefined hand gestures.
